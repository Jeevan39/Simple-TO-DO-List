# To-Do List Web Application

A simple, interactive, and user-friendly to-do list application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project helps users efficiently manage their tasks by adding, editing, marking, or deleting tasks.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can input tasks and add them to the task list.
- **Edit Tasks**: Users can modify existing tasks.
- **Delete Tasks**: Tasks can be removed from the list with a click.
- **Mark as Completed**: Users can mark tasks as completed by checking a box, and the text is visually struck through.
- **Live Task Counter**: Displays the number of pending tasks dynamically.
- **Error Handling**: Displays an error message if the input field is empty while adding a task.
- **Responsive Design**: Adjusts seamlessly to different screen sizes for better usability.

## How It Works

1. **Adding a Task**:

   - Type a task into the input field.
   - Click the "Add" button to add the task to the list.
   - The task counter updates dynamically.

2. **Editing a Task**:

   - Click the pencil icon on a task to populate the input field with its content.
   - The task is removed from the list, allowing the user to update it and re-add.

3. **Deleting a Task**:

   - Click the trash icon on a task to delete it.
   - The task counter updates dynamically.

4. **Marking as Completed**:

   - Check the checkbox to mark a task as completed. The text will have a strikethrough effect.
   - Uncheck to mark it as incomplete. The task counter updates accordingly.

5. **Error Message**:
   - If the input field is empty and the "Add" button is clicked, a visible error message appears.
